## Data Types

1. Primitive
   (single, cannot be furthur divided)

- Integer
- Float
- String
- Boolean

2. Non Primitive
   (complex structures,can be divided into individuals that are primitive)

   2.1 Linear (order matters, one connected to another)

   - List
   - Tuple
   - Array
   - Linked List
   - Stack
   - Queue

     2.2 Non Linear (order does not matter)

   - Set
   - Dictionary
   - Tree
   - Graph

## Algorithms

1. sorting

- sort data is ascending or descending order.

2. search

- search for an individual data element.

3. graph

- work with data represented as a graph.

4. dynamic programming

- solve problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems

5. divide and conquer

- solving by dividing them into smaller sub-problems, then solving each independently then combining the results.

6. recursive

- breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature.
